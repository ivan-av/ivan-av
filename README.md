## Abstract

I'm interested in develop web services with React and implement and learn new technologies related with cloud services.

I am a proactive person who loves learning new technologies and trying to understand how things work. Being involved in the IT area has given me the opportunity to connect with people and challenge myself by seeking to provide services and solutions

I have skills in the scientific field of data analysis and research.
